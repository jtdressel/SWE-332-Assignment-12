SWE 332 Assignment 12
Due Thursday, December 1, 2011

Goal: Generics.

Consider the sample solution IStack I provided on Blackboard for homework 7.

Your assignment is to make this abstraction generic. In addition to the existing API, you should add a producer version of Bloch's method pushAll() method (the correct one on page 135).

You should find item 26 in Bloch, in which Bloch generifies a mutable Stack, an excellent overall guide.

Get rid of the Object [] array in the implementation. You can either replace it with a List or with something more efficient (for example, see the FlyStack solution).

Suppress all warnings that you cannot eliminate.

Summarize exactly what you did in a short report.



Bonus 1: Start with the FlyStack class instead of the IStack class. Otherwise, follow the same directions, where applicable. The static factory method is the tricky part here. (1 point.)

Bonus 2: In addition to Bonus 1, make the FlyStack class threadsafe. (1 point.)

Grading Criteria:

    Generics
    Replacement of the Object[] array.
    API provides all required methods.
    Report describing what you did.
